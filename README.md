# Smallest-Range-Covering-Elements-from-K-Lists

You have k lists of sorted integers in non-decreasing order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.

We define the range [a, b] is smaller than range [c, d] if b - a < d - c or a < c if b - a == d - c.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [[4,10,15,24,26],[0,9,12,20],[5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation: 
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]
Output: [1,1]
 

Constraints:

nums.length == k

1 <= k <= 3500

1 <= nums[i].length <= 50

-105 <= nums[i][j] <= 105

nums[i] is sorted in non-decreasing order.

# SOLUTION

Intuition
The key takeaway is to utilize a min-heap to track the minimum element from each list and a sliding window to track the range of numbers.

Approach
Initialize a min-heap (smallest element from each list, list index, index of element within the list)
Track current_max across all the k lists (for range)
Iterate through the lists by always popping the minimum element from the heap (by heap's nature) and checking the range between the minimum and the current maximum.
Update the smallest range whenever a smaller one is found.
Push the next element from the same list (the list from which the popped element came) into the heap. Update the current maximum as necessary.
Stop the iteration once any list runs out of elements.
Example
nums = [[4,10,15,24,26],[0,9,12,20],[5,18,22,30]]
# Heap initialization (element, list_idx, idx)
Heap: [(0, 1, 0), (4, 0, 0), (5, 2, 0)]

# Popping from this heap will result in returning (0, 1, 0)
Heap: [(4, 0, 0), (5, 2, 0)]

# After range updates, push the next element in 1st list to heap
Heap:  [(4, 0, 0), (5, 2, 0), (9, 1, 1)] 
# since it was 9 (bigger than 4 & 5), it goes to the end

# Keep doing this until it reaches one of the lists' end (break)
